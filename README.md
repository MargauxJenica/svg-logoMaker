# svg-logoMaker

## Description
Build a command-line application using Node.js that enables users to generate custom logos and save them as SVG files. The application should prompt users to select a color and shape, input text for the logo, and finally, save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

    1. User is prompted for information regarding their logo and an SVG is generated 
    2. Includes text, text color, shape, and shape color
    3. Text must not exceed 3 characters   
    4. Shape is either a circle, square, triangle
    5. Color must either be hexidecimal or keyword
    6. Logo must only be 300x200 pixels


The purpose of the assignment is to assess one's ability to create a functional Node.js command-line application that interacts with users, generates dynamic content (SVG logos in this case), and handles file I/O operations.
